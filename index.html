    <h1>Kitab Gaul Update 10/12/2015</h1>    
    <p>Exciting news! Last week we deployed a RESTful API to access Kitab Gaul data. Today, we published the public RESTful API documentation. Developers now have access to search, entries, and member information. Limited read-only access is available today, write access will be available in the future.</p>
    <p>You can read the API documentation at https://kitabgaul.com/api.</p>
    <p>We’ve added a link to the weekly updates and general stories to the footer of every page, and we’ve fixed minor bugs.</p>
    <p>We’re busy working on Android and iOS apps, we’ll let you know when we have them complete!</p>
