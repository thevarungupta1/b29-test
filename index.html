    <h1>Kitab Gaul Update 10/12/2015</h1>    
    <p>Exciting news! Last week we deployed a RESTful API to access Kitab Gaul data. Today, we published the public RESTful API documentation. Developers now have access to search, entries, and member information. Limited read-only access is available today, write access will be available in the future.</p>
    <p>You can read the API documentation at https://kitabgaul.com/api.</p>
    <p>We’ve added a link to the weekly updates and general stories to the footer of every page, and we’ve fixed minor bugs.</p>
    <p>We’re busy working on Android and iOS apps, we’ll let you know when we have them complete!</p>

    <h2>Kitab Gaul Update 11/9/2015</h2>
    <p>We have an app!</p>
    <p>Kitab Gaul now has an app for Android. You can get free it via Amazon App Store. This initial release allows you to search and read entries in Kitab Gaul. It does not allow you to modify anything yet, we’re still working on it. iOS app is also still being worked on.</p>
    <p>Please try the app out and if you have any questions/comments, please send us a message.</p>

    <h3>Kitab Gaul Update 03/02/2021</h3>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
